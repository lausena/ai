            <p class="hero-description">
                I help teams make sense of AI by focusing on what lasts—not just what's trending.
                Whether it's integrating tools like Claude Code or designing MCP (Model Context Protocol) projects,
                the goal is always the same: build the right habits, architectures, and ways of thinking so teams
                are ready for whatever comes next.
            </p>
            <p class="hero-tagline">It's not about chasing models—it's about staying ready for change.</p>
