## Build AI That Lasts | Strategy, Integration & Principles for What’s Next.

I help teams make sense of AI by focusing on what lasts--not just what's trending.

Whether it's integrating tools like Claude Code or designing MCP (Model Context Protocol) projects, 
the goal is always the same: build the right habits, architectures, and ways of thinking so teams
are ready for whatever comes next. It's not about chasing models--it's about staying ready for change.

I would like to build a website that displays this messaging to emphasize the services I can provide.

To implement this we'll...

1. Build out a Python / Flask App
2. Dockerize the project for easy deployment on Digital Ocean
3. Test the functionality with Pytest

## Implementation Notes

Just use best practices when defining the folder structure for a Python/Flask app.
Keep in mind that this will be deployed to a digital ocean droplet and i will also need to do quick local development.

The following is some suggestions but feel free to be creative in terms of the content in each of these pages.

### 👤 About

Hi, I’m Gabriel Sena, an AI systems strategist focused on long-term readiness in a fast-moving field.

### Why I Built EvalPoint.
I've seen too many teams chase models or tools without a plan — wasting time, budget, and opportunity. I believe the key to successful AI adoption lies in strong design choices, modular thinking, and a clear understanding of your organization’s goals. 

### My Experience
- Deep expertise in AI Tooling (Claude Code, Gemini, etc.,) and  MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- 15+ years in software and data platforms
- Advisor to startups and enterprise teams on AI integration strategy
- Focused on practical implementation, not hype.

I work best with teams who are curious, ambitious, and ready to invest in doing AI *right*.

## Design and Styling Requirements
- Futuristic, professional look and feel with a minimalist design approach.
- Color palette should use neutral, metallic, and futuristic tones — think graphite gray, steel blue, brushed silver, and subtle accents of electric cyan or neon lime to represent AI and innovation.
- High readability fonts; use clean sans-serif typefaces.
- Mobile-first layout that adapts gracefully to desktop.


## Validation 
- use `uv run pytest` to validate the tests pass
- use `uv run app.py --help` to validate the project works
